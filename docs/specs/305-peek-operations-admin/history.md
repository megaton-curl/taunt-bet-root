# Implementation History — 305-peek-operations-admin

Iteration log for the autonomous spec loop. Each entry records what was
attempted and whether it succeeded. The agent reads this file at the start
of every iteration to understand prior context.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-04-25

- Added `jose@6.2.2` to `peek/package.json` as a runtime dep.
- Rewrote `peek/src/server/cloudflare-access.ts` on top of `jose`:
  `jwtVerify` with `algorithms: ['RS256']`, `audience`, `issuer`, and
  `currentDate`, using `createLocalJWKSet` when callers pass an in-memory
  JWKS (test path) and `createRemoteJWKSet` against
  `${teamDomain}/cdn-cgi/access/certs` otherwise (cached per issuer).
- Removed all custom RSA/JWKS/base64url/JSON-claim crypto helpers; mapped
  jose error subclasses (`JWTExpired`, `JWTClaimValidationFailed` with
  `claim === "iss"`/`"aud"`, `JOSEAlgNotAllowed`, `JOSENotSupported`,
  `JWKSNoMatchingKey`, `JWSSignatureVerificationFailed`,
  `JWKSTimeout`/`JWKSInvalid`/`JWKInvalid`, `JWTInvalid`/`JWSInvalid`)
  back onto the existing `CloudflareAccessVerificationReason` union so
  callers and existing tests are unchanged.
- Preserved the public surface: `verifyCloudflareAccessJwt`,
  `getVerifiedCloudflareAccessEmailFromHeaders`, and
  `VERIFIED_ACCESS_EMAIL_HEADER` keep their shapes; `proxy.ts` and
  `app/layout.tsx` need no edits.
- Targeted check: `pnpm --dir peek lint`, `pnpm --dir peek typecheck`,
  and `pnpm --dir peek test` — all green; 21/21 unit tests pass.

## Iteration 2 — 2026-04-25

- Expanded `peek/src/server/__tests__/cloudflare-access.test.ts` for the
  jose-backed verifier: malformed token, expired (`exp` in the past),
  invalid issuer (signed with `https://other.cloudflareaccess.com`),
  invalid audience, bad signature (sign with key A, present JWK B with
  the same `kid`), `alg: "none"` rejection, missing email claim
  (returns `ok: true, email: null`), and case/whitespace normalization
  (`"  Admin@Example.COM  "` → `"admin@example.com"`).
- Lowercased + trimmed in `normalizeEmail` so the verified email
  identity is canonical for FR-2 role matching.
- Replaced the implicit `NODE_ENV === "development"` bypass in
  `peek/proxy.ts` with the spec-required explicit `PEEK_DEV_ACCESS_EMAIL`
  bypass: dev-only, validates email shape, sets the
  `VERIFIED_ACCESS_EMAIL_HEADER` so server context still gets a normalized
  actor identity. Production never honors the bypass; missing CF env in
  prod still returns 500.
- Rewrote `peek/src/server/__tests__/cloudflare-access-middleware.test.ts`
  with `vi.stubEnv` (TS forbids assigning to `process.env.NODE_ENV`) and
  added: prod blocks without JWT (existing), prod 500 on missing CF env,
  prod ignores `PEEK_DEV_ACCESS_EMAIL`, dev honors `PEEK_DEV_ACCESS_EMAIL`
  with case normalization, dev rejects malformed `PEEK_DEV_ACCESS_EMAIL`.
- Targeted check (peek): `pnpm lint` ✅, `pnpm typecheck` ✅,
  `pnpm test` ✅ (31/31, +10 new).
