Iteration log for the autonomous spec loop. Each entry records what was
attempted and whether it succeeded. The agent reads this file at the start
of every iteration to understand prior context.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-04-25

- Added `jose@6.2.2` to `peek/package.json` as a runtime dep.
- Rewrote `peek/src/server/cloudflare-access.ts` on top of `jose`:
  `jwtVerify` with `algorithms: ['RS256']`, `audience`, `issuer`, and
  `currentDate`, using `createLocalJWKSet` when callers pass an in-memory
  JWKS (test path) and `createRemoteJWKSet` against
  `${teamDomain}/cdn-cgi/access/certs` otherwise (cached per issuer).
- Removed all custom RSA/JWKS/base64url/JSON-claim crypto helpers; mapped
  jose error subclasses (`JWTExpired`, `JWTClaimValidationFailed` with
  `claim === "iss"`/`"aud"`, `JOSEAlgNotAllowed`, `JOSENotSupported`,
  `JWKSNoMatchingKey`, `JWSSignatureVerificationFailed`,
  `JWKSTimeout`/`JWKSInvalid`/`JWKInvalid`, `JWTInvalid`/`JWSInvalid`)
  back onto the existing `CloudflareAccessVerificationReason` union so
  callers and existing tests are unchanged.
- Preserved the public surface: `verifyCloudflareAccessJwt`,
  `getVerifiedCloudflareAccessEmailFromHeaders`, and
  `VERIFIED_ACCESS_EMAIL_HEADER` keep their shapes; `proxy.ts` and
  `app/layout.tsx` need no edits.
- Targeted check: `pnpm --dir peek lint`, `pnpm --dir peek typecheck`,
  and `pnpm --dir peek test` — all green; 21/21 unit tests pass.
