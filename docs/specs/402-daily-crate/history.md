## Iteration 1 — Phase 0 schema migration

- Authored `backend/migrations/032_daily_crate.sql` per FR-9 step ordering:
  - Pre-condition assertion `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crate_drops WHERE trigger_type='game_settled' = 0` via `DO $$ ... RAISE EXCEPTION` block; aborts the whole migration transaction on violation.
  - `daily_crate_runs` (PK day_id) with status CHECK + table-level CHECK enforcing `status='completed' ⇒ all seed/config fields populated`.
  - `daily_crate_rewards` (BIGINT identity PK) with `UNIQUE (user_id, day_id)`, status CHECK over the 8 lifecycle states, hold_reason CHECK enforcing the held↔reason invariant, crate_type CHECK, `contents_amount > 0` CHECK, FK to `daily_crate_runs(day_id)`.
  - Three partial/full indexes on `daily_crate_rewards`: `_user_pending` (partial, NOT IN granted/failed/rejected), `_retry` (partial, awaiting_funds + sol), `_day_status`.
  - Partial index `idx_game_entries_daily_crate_settled_user` on `game_entries (settled_at, user_id) WHERE settled_at IS NOT NULL AND is_winner IS NOT NULL`.
  - Tightened `crate_drops_trigger_type_check` to `('challenge_completed','bonus_completed')`.
  - Extended `point_grants_source_type_check` to add `'daily_crate'` while preserving every value from migration 018.
  - `INSERT INTO payout_controls VALUES ('daily_crate_sol') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
- Updated three integration test fixtures (`crate-drop-handler.test.ts`, `crate-sol-payout.test.ts`, `points-and-crates-routes.test.ts`) that hard-coded `trigger_type='game_settled'` to use `'challenge_completed'` instead. The handler's logic doesn't filter on trigger_type; this preserves test coverage on the still-supported challenge/bonus path. The production `game-settled.ts` still emits `CRATE_DROP` with the now-rejected trigger; that emit removal is Phase 5's job.
- Verified: `pnpm migrate` (apply + idempotent re-run), `pnpm typecheck:self`, `pnpm lint:self`, `pnpm test:unit:self` (286 tests pass), `pnpm test:integration:self` (251 tests pass).
- Outcome: ✅ Item 1 complete.

## Iteration 2 — Phase 1 daily-crate config registry

- Added the `canonicalize` (RFC 8785 JCS) dependency to `backend/package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`; needed because the spec's hash invariant (cross-language reproducibility) requires JCS canonicalization rather than `JSON.stringify`.
- Authored `backend/src/config/economy/schema.ts`:
  - `Outcome`, `Tier`, `DailyCrateConfig` types.
  - Zod schemas using `superRefine` (Zod v4 dropped the function-style refine signature) enforcing positive `version`, contiguous tier numbers 1..N, strictly-ascending `threshold_lamports`, per-tier ppm-sum-exactly-1_000_000, positive bigint amounts, and registry-level uniqueness + strictly-ascending source order.
  - `validateDailyCrateConfigs(input)` collects all issues and throws with a multi-line message.
- Authored `backend/src/config/economy/mainnet/daily-crate-configs.ts` with the launch `version: 1` covering all 13 tiers from the CSV. ppm computed as `round(percentage * 10000)`, rounding residual subtracted from each tier's largest-ppm row so every tier sums to exactly 1,000,000 (verified by an independent generator script + the per-tier-sum unit test).
- Authored `backend/src/config/economy/dev/daily-crate-configs.ts` as a re-export of the mainnet registry; spec says they ship identical at launch and may diverge later for QA fixtures.
- Authored `backend/src/config/economy/index.ts`:
  - Module-import-time validation of both registries (boot-fail on malformed config).
  - `getDailyCrateRegistry(cluster)` and `getActiveDailyCrateConfig(cluster)` — selecting `mainnet`/`mainnet-beta` → mainnet, anything else → dev. `getActiveDailyCrateConfig` linearly scans for the highest-version entry rather than relying on array order.
  - `getDailyCrateConfigHash(config)` = `sha256(canonicalize(jsonReady(config)))` — bigint fields serialized as JSON strings before canonicalization, throws if `canonicalize` returns `undefined` (defensive; can't happen on a validated config).
- Added `backend/src/__tests__/daily-crate-config.test.ts` with 20 unit tests:
  - Launch registries pass validation; every tier in every committed config sums to exactly 1,000,000 ppm.
  - Malformed config rejection: ppm sum mismatch, non-contiguous tier numbers, non-ascending thresholds, duplicate versions, non-ascending source order, non-positive version, non-positive amount.
  - `getActiveDailyCrateConfig` returns version 1 for mainnet/devnet/unknown-cluster.
  - Selection logic returns highest-version when seeded out-of-order.
  - Hash is stable across calls, matches between mainnet and dev at launch, changes on ppm/threshold edits, and is independent of source-object key order (JCS property test).
- Deleted `docs/references/daily-crate.csv` per spec FR-9.
- Verified: `pnpm lint:self` (1 pre-existing warning, 0 errors), `pnpm typecheck:self` (clean), `pnpm test:unit:self` (306 tests pass — was 286 pre-iteration; +20 from the new file).
- Skipped: `pnpm test:integration:self` — Postgres is not running in this iteration's environment (`ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432`), pre-existing and unrelated to this iteration's pure-config / pure-unit-test changes. The autonomous-loop targeted-check rule for TS changes is `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck`; both green.
- Outcome: ✅ Item 2 complete.

## Iteration 3 — Phase 1 day-volume helpers (FR-1)

- Authored `backend/src/services/daily-crate.ts`:
  - `dayIdBoundsUtc(dayId)` — strict `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` regex + `Date` NaN-check; returns half-open `[start, end)` constructed via `new Date(${dayId}T00:00:00.000Z)` and `start + 86_400_000ms`. No `::date` casts anywhere; rejects malformed strings (`"2026-5-8"`, `"2026/05/08"`, `""`) and unreal calendar dates (`"2026-13-01"`).
  - `computeDayLamports(sql, userId, dayId): Promise<bigint>` — single-user `SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount_lamports), 0)::TEXT FROM game_entries WHERE user_id = $1 AND settled_at >= $2 AND settled_at < $3 AND is_winner IS NOT NULL`. Casts to TEXT then `BigInt()` to keep numeric precision regardless of the postgres driver's bigint coercion. Returns `0n` when there are no qualifying rows. Index: `idx_game_entries_user_settled (user_id, settled_at DESC)`.
  - `computeEligibleDailyVolumes(sql, dayId, floorLamports): Promise<{ userId, dayLamports }[]>` — single aggregate `SELECT user_id, SUM(amount_lamports)::TEXT … GROUP BY user_id HAVING SUM(amount_lamports) >= $floor::BIGINT`. Floor is bound as TEXT and cast in SQL to keep the binding bigint-safe. Below-floor users are filtered at the SQL layer so the worker never streams ineligible rows. Throws on negative floor. Index: `idx_game_entries_daily_crate_settled_user` (partial, settled_at + user_id, WHERE is_winner IS NOT NULL — created in iteration 1's migration).
- Authored `backend/src/__tests__/daily-crate-volume.test.ts` (registered in `vitest.integration.files.ts`):
  - Pure `dayIdBoundsUtc` block (6 tests) — bounds correctness, month/year/leap rollover, malformed-input rejection. Runs without a DB connection because `beforeAll` only fires for the second describe.
  - Integration block (9 tests) covering `computeDayLamports` happy path, refund exclusion (`is_winner IS NULL`), day-boundary assignment by `settled_at` (23:59:59.999 of day N stays on day N; 00:00:00.000 of day N+1 falls into day N+1, half-open exclusivity), `settled_at IS NULL` exclusion, per-user isolation; and `computeEligibleDailyVolumes` floor cutoff, exact-equality inclusion, empty-result, and negative-floor rejection.
- Verified `pnpm lint:self` (1 pre-existing warning, 0 errors) and `pnpm typecheck:self` (clean). The targeted check for TS changes is `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck`; both green.
- Verified `pnpm test:unit:self` (306 tests pass, unchanged from iteration 2 — `daily-crate-volume.test.ts` is integration-only).
- Skipped `pnpm test:integration:self`: the dev devcontainer's Postgres listens only on the Unix socket `/var/run/postgresql` and the existing `makeSql()` fallback hardcodes `taunt_bet_dev` while the live DB is `rng_utopia_dev`. Same pre-existing infra gap as iteration 2; unrelated to this iteration.
- Manually exercised the implementation against the live `rng_utopia_dev` database via a one-off node script that mirrored the four `computeDayLamports` / `computeEligibleDailyVolumes` test scenarios. All assertions held: basic refund-excluding sum = 150_000_000n; boundary day-N = 10_000_000n / day-N+1 = 20_000_000n; floor exclusion returned exactly `[u_above → 400_000_000n]`; exact-equality floor inclusion returned `[u_exact → 100_000_000n]`. Cleaned up after the run.
- Outcome: ✅ Item 3 complete.

## Iteration 4 — Phase 1 tier/roll/reward-hash pure helpers (FR-4, FR-5, FR-3)

- Extended `backend/src/services/daily-crate.ts`:
  - `determineTier(config, dayLamports)` — single forward scan, breaking once a strictly-greater threshold is seen (registry order is validated as strictly ascending). Returns the last tier whose `threshold_lamports <= dayLamports`, or `null` when below floor.
  - `rollDailyCrateOutcome(blockhash, userId, dayId, configVersion, tier)` — canonicalizes `{ domain: "daily_crate_roll:v1", blockhash, user_id, day_id, config_version, tier }` (snake_case keys per spec), SHA256s, reads first 8 bytes as BE u64 via `Buffer.readBigUInt64BE` (avoids Number truncation), `mod 1_000_000n`, then walks `tier.outcomes` accumulating ppm and returns the first whose running sum strictly exceeds `rollValue`, plus the selected outcome's range `[startInclusive, endExclusive)`. Integer-only — ppm sums fit comfortably in Number (always ≤ 1_000_000), comparison is strict-`>`. Throws on impossible no-selection (defensive against config corruption that bypassed Zod).
  - `computeRewardHash(input)` — accepts mixed bigint/number numeric fields; coerces via `toSafeInteger` which throws on non-integer / non-finite / out-of-Number-safe-range bigints (per spec, every numeric field comfortably fits in 2^53; bumping past that requires `daily_crate:v2` semantics). Builds the canonical reward envelope, JCS, SHA256, hex.
- Authored `backend/src/__tests__/fixtures/generate-daily-crate-vectors.py` — independent Python JCS+SHA256 reference. Hand-transcribes the launch v1 mainnet config (13 tiers × 12-13 outcomes each), defines `jcs_bytes(obj) = json.dumps(sort_keys=True, separators=(',',':'), ensure_ascii=False).encode('utf-8')` (verified equivalent to the JS `canonicalize` v3 package on the restricted ASCII/integer/bool/null input set the spec uses), and emits 6 hand-picked test cases covering tier 1, 3, 5, 8, and 13 with diverse `(blockhash, user_id, day_id)` combinations. Output committed to `daily-crate-vectors.json` alongside the script.
- Authored `backend/src/__tests__/daily-crate-roll.test.ts` (32 tests, pure unit — no DB):
  - `determineTier` (4 tests): below floor returns null; each threshold returns its tier; just-above-lower / just-below-upper between any adjacent thresholds returns the lower tier (covers the spec's worked example `0.6 SOL → tier 3`); above-top returns the top tier.
  - Cross-language fixtures (7 tests): JS-side `getDailyCrateConfigHash` matches the Python `config_hash`, then for each of 6 fixture cases JS reproduces the Python `rollValue`, outcome (item_type/amount/ppm), `outcomeRange`, and `rewardHash` byte-exact. Drift in either the JS canonicalization or the launch config content fails the test.
  - Determinism + integer invariants (3 tests): same inputs always yield same output; `rollValue` and outcomeRange bounds are integers in valid range; varying user_id changes the roll.
  - Distribution sweep (13 tests, one per launch-config tier): walk every roll 0..999_999, count outcome hits, assert each count equals the declared `ppm`. This is the strongest possible structural check — catches off-by-one in the strict-`>` boundary, accidental skip/double-count, and any FP creep.
  - `computeRewardHash` invariants (5 tests): stable across calls; identical bytes for number-vs-bigint numeric inputs; changes when any single field changes; rejects non-integer / NaN inputs; rejects bigints exceeding 2^53.
- Verified `pnpm lint:self` (1 pre-existing warning unrelated to this iteration, 0 errors), `pnpm typecheck:self` (clean), `pnpm test:unit:self` (338 tests pass, +32 from this iteration — was 306 pre-iteration). Targeted check for TS changes is `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck`; both green.
- Skipped `pnpm test:integration:self`: same pre-existing infra gap as iterations 2/3 (Postgres only on Unix socket, fixture DB name mismatch). This iteration is pure-function-only — no DB schema or query touched — so integration tests are not load-bearing here.
- Outcome: ✅ Item 4 complete.
